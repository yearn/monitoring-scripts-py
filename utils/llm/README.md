# AI Transaction Explainer

Generates human-readable explanations for queued governance transactions (timelocks and Safe multisigs) by combining calldata decoding, on-chain state reads, verified-source natspec, Tenderly simulation, and LLM inference.

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. Calldata Decoding (`utils/calldata/decoder.py`)

Converts raw hex calldata into a structured `DecodedCall`:

1. Extract the 4-byte function selector (first 4 bytes after `0x`)
2. When the call's `target` + `chain_id` are known, resolve the signature from the target's **verified ABI** first (`get_function_signature_by_selector`, EIP-1967/getter proxy-aware) — more reliable than 4byte, which can't disambiguate selector collisions
3. Otherwise look up the selector in `utils/calldata/known_selectors.py` (local table)
4. If still unresolved, query the [Sourcify 4byte API](https://api.4byte.sourcify.dev)
5. Parse the function signature to extract parameter types
6. Decode parameters using `eth_abi.decode()`

Result: `DecodedCall(function_name="upgradeTo", signature="upgradeTo(address)", params=[("address", "0x...")])`

### 2. Verified Source Context (`utils/source_context.py`)

For each `(target, function)` pair, fetches the verified Solidity source via the Etherscan v2 multichain API and extracts:

- The function's preceding natspec block + signature line
- Declarations + natspec for state variables the function writes

If the function isn't found in the target's source (e.g., the target is an `ERC1967Proxy` / `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`), follows the EIP-1967 implementation slot and retries against the impl source. Caches per `(chain_id, address)` for the workflow run.

Requires `ETHERSCAN_TOKEN`. Failures degrade gracefully — no `--- Contract Source Context ---` section is added.

#### Disk-Backed Source And Label Cache

Verified source/ABI lookups and Swiss Knife labels are cached under `CACHE_DIR` via `utils/disk_cache.py`:

- `source-cache/`: Etherscan verified contract name, source, and ABI JSON.
- `label-cache/`: Swiss Knife address labels.

Positive entries do not expire because verified source and curated labels are effectively stable for a given address. Negative entries use a short TTL so a newly verified contract or newly labeled address is picked up later. Tunables:

- `CACHE_DIR`: parent directory for cache namespaces. Empty/default means the repo working directory; systemd should set a persistent cache path.
- `CACHE_NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS`: TTL for negative entries, default `86400`.
- `SOURCE_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`: source-cache entry cap, default `5000`.
- `SOURCE_CACHE_MAX_BYTES`: source-cache size cap, default `268435456`.
- `LABEL_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`: label-cache entry cap, default `50000`.

Writes are atomic (`mkstemp` + `os.replace`) and same-process duplicate lookups are single-flighted per key, so a Safe batch with repeated targets does not fan out duplicate Etherscan/Swiss Knife calls. Debug logs include memory/disk hit/miss counters, which are useful after deploy for confirming the VPS cache is warm.

### 3. On-chain Before-State (`utils/on_chain_state.py`)

For setter-style calls, reads the *current* on-chain value of state variables the function will write so the LLM can quote concrete before→after deltas instead of guessing scale.

Handles:

- **Simple public state vars** (uint*/int*/address/bool/bytes*/string) via the auto-generated no-arg getter.
- **Single-key mappings** where setter args include the mapping key type (e.g., `mapping(address => uint256) public coverageCap` paired with `setCoverageCap(address, uint256)`).
- **Diamond-storage / non-public-var setters** via a speculative getter-guess from the setter signature (last arg = value type, leading args = key types). If wrong, the eth_call reverts and is skipped gracefully.

Follows EIP-1967 proxies to locate the function source, but issues `eth_call`s against the original storage-holder address.

### 4. Tenderly Simulation (`utils/tenderly/simulation.py`)

Simulates the transaction against current on-chain state to get:

- **Success/failure** status and gas used
- **Token transfers** (ERC-20 balance changes)
- **State changes** (storage slot diffs)
- **Emitted events** (decoded log entries)

Requires `TENDERLY_API_KEY`. Simulation failure is non-blocking — the pipeline continues with the decoded calldata only.

**State overrides** (`state_objects`) reduce false reverts. When a call forwards ETH (`value > 0`), the executor (timelock/Safe) often doesn't hold that balance, so a faithful sim would revert with "insufficient funds" — a false negative. `_merge_balance_override` grants the sender exactly the forwarded `value`. Callers can pass additional overrides (e.g. a role/owner storage slot) to unblock access-gated setters; caller-supplied values win on conflict.

Callers can pass `skip_simulation=True` to bypass Tenderly entirely. Used for Safe transactions with `operation=DELEGATECALL` (typically multiSend batches), where our plain-CALL simulator can't model the real execution and would produce a spurious "revert" verdict.

### 5. Proxy Upgrade Detection & Implementation Diff (`utils/proxy.py`, `utils/impl_diff.py`)

`detect_proxy_upgrade(data_hex, target)` recognizes three patterns and returns a `ProxyUpgrade(proxy_address, new_implementation)` dataclass:

| Selector | Function | Proxy address source |
|---|---|---|
| `0x3659cfe6` | `upgradeTo(address)` | tx target |
| `0x4f1ef286` | `upgradeToAndCall(address,bytes)` | tx target |
| `0x9623609d` | `upgradeAndCall(address,address,bytes)` (OZ ProxyAdmin) | first calldata arg |

For the ProxyAdmin pattern, the tx target is the ProxyAdmin and the actual proxy is inside the calldata — the Telegram alert surfaces both. Detection short-circuits on the selector check *before* calldata decoding, so non-upgrade calls don't trigger the Sourcify 4byte lookup.

When an upgrade is detected the pipeline:

1. Reads the **current implementation** from the EIP-1967 storage slot (`0x360894a...`) of the proxy, falling back to the legacy zeppelinos slot (`0x7050c9e...`) for pre-EIP-1967 proxies like USDC's `FiatTokenProxy`.
2. Builds an Etherscan diff URL: `etherscan.io/contractdiffchecker?a1=old&a2=new`.
3. Fetches the verified source of **both** implementations and runs a structural diff (`utils/impl_diff.py`):
   - **Functions added / removed / changed visibility or modifiers**, identified by name + arg types so overloads are distinct.
   - **Storage layout safety check** — slot-by-slot comparison. Safe iff the new layout begins with the old layout in the same order (append-only) OR an OZ trailing `uintN[K] __gap` array is consumed: any new vars inserted before the gap must be matched by an equal reduction in the gap's size. Gap underflow, no-shrink, and gap removal without consumption are flagged.
   - **EIP-7201 namespaced storage** is detected (`_getXxxStorage() returns (XxxStorage storage $)`) and the positional layout check is skipped — namespaced storage lives at a constant slot, not slot 0+.
   - Immutable/`constant` state vars are excluded from the layout check (they don't occupy a storage slot).
   - State vars without an explicit visibility modifier (default-internal) ARE included — function locals are excluded by brace-depth tracking rather than by requiring a visibility keyword.

The structural diff is injected into the prompt under `--- Implementation Diff ---`. Best-effort: if either impl is unverified or extraction fails, the diff section is silently omitted but the rest of the upgrade context still renders.

### 5b. Deterministic Safety Checks (`utils/llm/ai_explainer.py`, `utils/source_context.py`)

`_collect_safety_checks()` runs seatbelt-style checks grounded in Etherscan data we already fetch, and surfaces them as hard facts under `--- Safety Checks ---`:

- **Unverified target** — a governance tx whose target has no published source is a red flag (`get_verification_status` returns a tri-state; the note is emitted only on an explicit `False`, never on a fetch error, so it doesn't cry wolf).
- **ETH to a non-payable function** — forwarding `value > 0` to a `nonpayable` function reverts and can strand funds (`get_function_state_mutability`, with EIP-1967 proxy follow; overloaded functions resolve to `payable` if any overload accepts value).

The system prompt instructs the LLM to treat each item as verified and reflect it in the verdict (e.g. an unverified target is at least MEDIUM).

### 5c. Deterministic Token Flows (`utils/llm/ai_explainer.py`)

`_collect_token_flows()` normalizes ERC20 movement amounts in Python so the LLM never has to do decimal arithmetic — the source of a real bug where a Safe-batch summary reported `~50.8k` for a `~50.78`-token transfer while the detail was correct. For each call whose signature is a known movement (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `mint`, `burn`, `approve`) on a token with discoverable decimals, it divides the raw amount by `10**decimals` using `Decimal` (exact, no float error) and emits a `--- Token Flows (computed — authoritative amounts) ---` section with per-recipient amounts and a per-token **Total moved** (`approve` is listed but not summed — it's an allowance). The system prompt marks these amounts authoritative: the model must quote them verbatim rather than re-derive from raw units.

This matters most on Safe multisig alerts, which run with `skip_simulation=True` (DELEGATECALL batches our plain-CALL simulator can't model) and so have no Tenderly asset-change rows with pre-normalized amounts.

Normalization goes through `normalize_token_amount()` (`utils/formatting.py`), which builds the `Decimal` by shifting the exponent instead of dividing. Division is evaluated at `decimal.getcontext().prec`, and several modules set that **globally** at import time (`utils/defillama.py` uses 18) — enough to silently truncate a 25-digit 18-decimal amount depending on which modules the process happened to import.

### 5d. Related Tokens (`utils/related_tokens.py`)

Token Flows only covers calls that *move* a token. A governance call like `setEpochEmissions(uint256 epoch, uint256 emissions)` carries an amount with no address argument at all, so the LLM had no decimals and — correctly, per the anti-guessing rule — hedged: *"raw units, equal to X at 1e18 normalization; token decimals are unconfirmed."*

`resolve_related_tokens()` closes that gap generically. It reads the target's verified ABI (already disk-cached by `source_context`, so no extra HTTP via `fetch_abi_entries()`), picks out every zero-arg `view` getter returning an `address`, batch-calls them, and keeps the results that `fetch_erc20_metadata` confirms are ERC20:

```
--- Related Tokens (resolved on-chain from the target) ---
0xaC6985…64e8 (RewardsDistributor):
  jane() -> 0x33333333…3404 (JANE, 18 decimals)
```

Filtering on "is it actually an ERC20" is what makes this need no configuration — `owner()` drops out on its own, no name blocklist. The target being itself a token is reported as `getter="self"`. Capped at `MAX_GETTER_CALLS` (8) per target, memoized per `(chain_id, target)`, and best-effort: any failure yields `[]` and the alert proceeds unchanged.

The system prompt treats **exactly one** resolved token as verified decimals — state the amount and symbol, no hedge. Zero or several tokens keeps the hedge, since normalizing would be a guess. The Call Flow also annotates raw `uint*` values with `(≈ 5,369,214.23 JANE)`, but only above `10 ** (decimals - 3)` so an epoch number like `43` isn't rendered as `0.000000000000000043 JANE`.

### 5e. Infinifi Escrow Context (`utils/llm/infinifi_context.py`)

Infinifi RWA rate-manager calls target `RWAEscrowRateManager` and pass the affected escrow as an address argument. The generic Related Tokens resolver only inspects the direct call target, so it cannot identify the farm or tokens behind that escrow.

For Infinifi mainnet alerts, the adapter:

1. Identifies candidate `RWAEscrow` contracts by their verified ABI (`assetToken()`, `owner()`, and `totalAssets()`).
2. Matches the owner address to the public Infinifi farm API and verifies that the farm's on-chain `escrow()` getter returns the candidate.
3. Reads the accounting asset and current total assets on-chain.
4. Reconstructs the escrow's current whitelist from `WhitelistUpdated` events and identifies non-accounting targets that verify as ERC20 tokens. Token names, symbols, and decimals are read on-chain.

The result is added to the LLM prompt as verified protocol context and rendered independently in the Wavey Gist under `## Protocol Context`. The report distinguishes the escrow's accounting asset from non-accounting ERC20 targets it is allowed to interact with; whitelist membership does not establish how a token is valued downstream. Failures are best-effort and never block the governance alert.

### 5f. 3Jane Governance Context (`utils/llm/threejane_context.py`)

Both 3Jane timelocks schedule calls that arrive as opaque data. `ProtocolConfig.setConfig(bytes32,uint256)` names the parameter it changes only by `keccak256("<NAME>")`, and `RewardsDistributor.setEpochEmissions` / `updateRoot` allocate JANE without revealing whether a claim mints new supply or moves an existing balance.

For 3Jane mainnet alerts, the adapter:

1. Reverses every `bytes32` argument against a checked-in name table (`ProtocolConfig` keys plus the Jane / EmergencyController roles), so the prompt carries `keccak256("MAX_LTV")` and what that key controls instead of a bare hash. Hashes outside the table stay unresolved rather than being guessed at.
2. Reads the current stored value for resolved `ProtocolConfig` keys, following EIP-1967 to the implementation ABI since the config sits behind a transparent proxy. Role hashes get no value line — there is nothing to read.
3. Identifies a `RewardsDistributor` by its verified getters and reads `useMint`, the reward token's metadata and `totalSupply`, whether the distributor holds `MINTER_ROLE`, whether token transfers are globally enabled, `maxClaimable` / `totalClaimed`, the current `merkleRoot`, and the current epoch.
4. Reads emissions already stored for the epoch being set and the three before it, and derives how the proposed allocation compares to the epoch before it, so a new allocation is judged against recent ones rather than called "substantial in absolute terms". Three consecutive weeks of this same operation had previously scored LOW, MEDIUM, MEDIUM.
5. Renders a capping key beside the quantity it caps (`USD3_SUPPLY_CAP` next to USD3 `totalAssets`), batched into the config read, so a ceiling raise reads as slack or as unblocking deposits. `_USAGE_READS` holds only pairs whose denominations are known to match.

Token amounts are truncated to whole tokens, matching the call flow's amount hints. Failures are best-effort and never block the governance alert.

### 5g. Adapter Registry (`utils/llm/protocol_context.py`)

Adapters register in `_ADAPTERS`; `resolve_protocol_context()` fans one call out to all of them and merges the rendered prompt text, report text, introduced addresses, and address labels. Each adapter guards its own protocol and chain, so registration order carries no meaning and one adapter raising is logged and skipped rather than dropping the alert.

### 6. LLM Prompt & Completion (`utils/llm/ai_explainer.py`)

The prompt is split into a **system** prompt (static instructions) and a **user** prompt (per-tx context). `complete(prompt, system_prompt=...)` passes the system block via the provider's native system role, which improves instruction-following and lets the Anthropic provider mark it `cache_control: ephemeral` — repeated alerts within the cache window pay for the (large) instruction prompt only once. The static block (`SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS`) enforces brevity:

- Starts with a verb, no "This transaction…" preamble
- Trailing risk tag in caps (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL)
- Summary is plain text (it goes to Telegram); the detail is markdown and must render **every address as a block-explorer hyperlink**, copied verbatim from the prompt's `--- Address Links ---` section so the model never assembles an explorer URL or picks the wrong chain's explorer
- Refuses to assume parameter units from function name alone; uses the Related Tokens section's decimals when exactly one token resolves, and hedges only when zero or several do
- Trusts source-context natspec over prior assumptions
- Quotes concrete before→after deltas when state reads are available
- Flags any divergence between a proposal's **stated intent** and the decoded actions

When a `description` is passed to the explainer, it renders under `--- Stated Intent (proposal description) ---` and the LLM compares stated intent against the calldata, flagging undisclosed role/ownership/upgrade or fund-movement changes.

Example assembled prompt:

### 7. Two-Stage Generation: Summary, then Detail Derived From It

`_generate_explanation()` produces the `Explanation` dataclass (`summary` → Telegram, `detail` → wrapped into `report` → Wavey Gist) in two stages so the two artifacts the team sees can never disagree on the headline number or risk verdict:

1. **Summary (authoritative).** `_generate_summary()` produces just the `summary` + `risk_tag`.
2. **Detail (derived).** `_expand_detail()` then writes the full report *from* the confirmed summary (`DETAIL_EXPANSION_TASK`), required to stay consistent with its magnitudes and risk level.

This fixes a failure mode where the model, generating both fields jointly, did the same decimal arithmetic twice and disagreed — e.g. a `~50.8k` summary while the report correctly showed `~50.78`. With the summary fixed first and the detail expanded from it, the linked report can elaborate the reasoning but cannot contradict the headline. (The deterministic **Token Flows** section makes the number correct in the first place; this stage keeps the two outputs in sync.)

**Structured summary (preferred).** When the provider advertises `supports_structured_output`, stage 1 is requested as JSON matching `SUMMARY_SCHEMA`:

```json
{ "summary": "Upgrades AAVE pool impl 0xOld → 0xNew. Verify audited.",
  "risk_tag": "MEDIUM" }
```

`risk_tag` is `enum`-constrained to `LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL`, so the Telegram tag is always valid — no regex extraction. OpenAI-compatible providers use `response_format: json_schema`; the Anthropic provider uses a forced tool call. `_explanation_from_json` maps the object to `Explanation`, appending `risk_tag` to the summary if the model didn't inline it. Stage 2 (`_expand_detail`) is a plain `complete()` call whose prompt carries the confirmed summary.

**Text fallback.** If structured output is disabled, fails, or returns an empty summary, stage 1 falls back to a single `complete()` call returning a joint `TLDR:`/`DETAIL:` block:

```
TLDR: Upgrades AAVE pool impl 0xOld → 0xNew. Verify audited. MEDIUM.

DETAIL:
Calls upgradeTo(address) on the AAVE pool proxy...
```

`_parse_explanation()` splits this with tolerant regex (handles `### DETAIL`, `**TLDR:**`, etc.); if the format isn't followed, the whole response becomes the summary (backward compatible). This degraded path keeps both fields from one completion and skips the separate expansion, so the derive-from-summary guarantee applies to the structured (production) path only.

Structured output is controlled by `LLM_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT` (per-provider default: on for `anthropic`/`openai`/`venice` — all verified live — off for `groq`/custom, since JSON-schema support varies by backend).

### 8. Optional Refine Pass

When `refine=True` is passed to `explain_transaction` / `explain_batch_transaction`, a second LLM call (`_refine_summary`) critiques the **summary** against a checklist (verb-leading TLDR, supported units, risk-magnitude consistency) and revises only if it finds concrete issues. It runs *before* detail expansion — the summary is authoritative, so it's the artifact worth refining; the detail is then derived from the revised summary. Hard rules forbid introducing new unit assumptions, removing hedges, escalating LOW out of caution, or style-only churn. Falls back to the draft on `PASS`, on any `LLMError`, or on an empty revision. Always uses the text path.

Cost: ~1 extra LLM call per alert when enabled. Default is **off**.

### 9. Output Formatting

`format_explanation_line()` uses only the summary for the Telegram message:

```
🤖 *AI Summary:*
Upgrades AAVE pool impl 0xOld → 0xNew. Verify audited. MEDIUM.
[Full details](https://gist.wavey.info/abc123)
```

The "Full details" link points to a Wavey Gist upload of the **full report**
(`Explanation.report`, built by `utils/llm/report.py`). The gist is titled
`<contract> - <DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM> - <RISK>` (UTC, e.g.
`Infinifi Shorttimelock - 11/08/2026 10:00 - LOW`) so a list of reports is
scannable; it falls back to the protocol name, then `AI Transaction Analysis`.
When no report was built (e.g. an explanation generated without report context),
the bare detail is published under the fallback title instead.

### 10. Gist Report (`utils/llm/report.py`)

The gist is the artifact a reviewer actually opens, so it carries more than the LLM's prose:

```

The table deduplicates the executor, alert contract, call targets, address-valued calldata arguments, and addresses introduced by protocol adapters. Every description is prefixed with its role so multi-use addresses remain unambiguous. Roles and descriptions come from those deterministic relationships; the LLM does not generate them.

**Call Flow is built in Python, not asked of the LLM** — it comes straight from the
decoded calldata (`CallEntry` per call: target, signature, ABI parameter names, ETH
value, nested `bytes` payloads unwrapped up to `MAX_BYTES_RECURSION_DEPTH`), so it
can't be hallucinated, re-ordered, or summarized away. Arrays and tuple/struct
arguments are decomposed recursively (`array_element_type` / `tuple_component_types`),
so an address inside a `MarketParams`-style struct is still rendered as a link and
still reaches label lookup and the Address Links section — `iter_address_values()`
walks the same type structure for collection. Every address is rendered
full-length (never truncated) as a link to the chain's explorer from
`EXPLORER_URLS`, annotated with its contract label / token symbol when known;
chains with no configured explorer degrade to plain code spans.

`format_address_links_block()` reuses the same renderer to give the LLM the exact
markdown link for each address in the transaction — that's what makes the
"always hyperlink addresses" rule reliable in the generated analysis.

The header's **Contract** line links to `ReportContext.label_address`, which
defaults to the executing timelock/Safe (`from_address`). Safe multisend batches
label the *utility* contract instead, so `_explain_safe_tx()` passes the outer
target as `label_address` in that path.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `venice` | Provider name: `venice`, `groq`, `openai`, `anthropic`, or custom |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | *(required)* | API key for the LLM provider |
| `LLM_MODEL` | `deepseek-v4-flash` | Model identifier |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | *(per provider)* | API base URL (not needed for anthropic) |
| `LLM_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT` | *(per provider)* | `true`/`false` to force JSON-schema output. Default: on for anthropic/openai/venice (all verified live), off for groq/custom |
| `WAVEY_GIST_API_KEY` | *(required for detail links)* | API key for publishing detailed AI reports to Wavey Gist |
| `ETHERSCAN_TOKEN` | *(optional)* | Etherscan v2 multichain API key for source context |
| `TENDERLY_API_KEY` | *(optional)* | Tenderly API key for simulation |
| `TENDERLY_ACCOUNT` | `yearn` | Tenderly account slug |
| `TENDERLY_PROJECT` | `sam` | Tenderly project slug |

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Base URL | Default Model | Package |

## Integration Points

- **Timelock alerts** (`timelock/timelock_alerts.py`): Calls `explain_transaction()` or `explain_batch_transaction()` for each scheduled operation.
- **Safe alerts** (`safe/main.py`): Routes through `_explain_safe_tx()`, which detects `operation=DELEGATECALL` multisend batches and dispatches to `explain_batch_transaction()` with `skip_simulation=True` and a DELEGATECALL context note. Plain CALL Safe txs use `explain_transaction()` as before.
- Both call sites use `format_explanation_line()` to append the AI summary to Telegram messages.
- Both call sites can opt into the refine pass per-protocol by passing `refine=True` to the explainer.

## Eval Harness

`tests/eval/` guards the prompt/pipeline against regressions with real mainnet fixtures (`fixtures.py`) and tolerant assertions — a risk tag within an acceptable band plus required/forbidden substrings, since LLM output isn't deterministic.

It makes live LLM + Etherscan + RPC calls (costs money), so it's **excluded from the default test suite**. Run it after prompt or pipeline changes:

```bash
python -m tests.eval.run_eval                          # standalone report, non-zero exit on failure
RUN_LLM_EVAL=1 python -m pytest tests/eval -v          # same cases as parametrized tests
```

Add a fixture whenever a prompt change fixes a specific failure mode (e.g. the intent-mismatch case asserts a misleading "no changes" description can't downgrade a real parameter change below MEDIUM).
