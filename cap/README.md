## Data Monitoring

The script [liquidity.py](./liquidity.py) is run [daily by Github actions](../.github/workflows/daily.yml#L84).

It monitors withdrawable liquidity for the CAP protocol's cUSD contract [`0xcCcc62962d17b8914c62D74FfB843d73B2a3cccC`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcCcc62962d17b8914c62D74FfB843d73B2a3cccC#code):

1. **Fetches all assets** from the cUSD contract
2. **For each asset**, calculates total withdrawable liquidity:
   - Withdrawable amount from the fractional reserve vault (via `maxWithdraw` for the cUSD contract)
   - Direct token balance held by the cUSD contract
3. **Sums normalized values** across all assets
4. **Sends Telegram alert** if total withdrawable liquidity falls below [defined threshold](./liquidity.py#L8) telegram alert is sent
5. **RedStone Price Feed for cUSD_FUNDAMENTAL** if the value falls below 99980000, telegram alert is sent. [Tenderly alert](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/yearn/sam/alerts/rules/316f440e-457b-4cfa-a69e-f7f54230bf44)
